            *Review: Oh dear, using that password is like leaving your front door wide open. Your password is very weak because it contains 2 female names,
            a sequence of characters and a dictionary word.

     BEST PRACTICES FOR STRONG PASSWORDS

     * Use at least 12â€“16 characters.

     * Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

     * Avoid dictionary words, names, or personal info.

     * Use passphrases instead of single words.

     * Do not reuse passwords across different accounts.

     * Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.
     
     
    TIPS LEARNED FROM EVALUATION

     * Adding symbols and mixed cases greatly increases strength.

     * Passwords longer than 12 characters are much harder to crack.

     * Randomness is better than predictable substitutions (e.g., Pa$$w0rd is still weak).

     * A unique, complex password for each account reduces risk if one is leaked.
     
     
    COMMON PASSWORD ATTACKS

     * Brute Force Attack: Automated trial of all possible combinations until the correct password is found.

     * Dictionary Attack: Uses common words and variations from a dictionary list to guess passwords.

     * Phishing: Trick users into revealing passwords through fake websites or emails.

     * Credential Stuffing: Using stolen passwords from leaks to try on other accounts.
